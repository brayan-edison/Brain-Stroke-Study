# Brain Stroke Analysis

## Objective:
To analyze brain strokes and to understand the trends and factors with the objective to answer following questions:

- What are the factors that contribute to a brain stroke?
- What is the statistical significance of various seemingly non-relative factors that could have an impact in brain stroke?
- Can we predict if a person is at a higher risk of having a brain stroke?
- And many more...

## Introduction:
### But what is a Brain Stroke?

The brain is the most vital part of our body, and indeed medically, a person is considered to be dead if the brain stops working or is dead. However, due to various reasons, there are times when the blood supply to the brain or certain parts of brain decreases or stops entirely. Now this could happen due to various reasons including severing of arteries or veins and blockage of arteries or veins and many more, among many other. 

### Is it deadly?
Certainly. As discussed earlier, brain is the most important organ in a human, and it is quite intuitive that the a problem in the organ that controls all functions would lead to some serious damage.

Some of the imminent effects include:

- Difficulty in balance.
- Sudden one-sided paralysis
- Headaches, with vomiting or unconsciousness
